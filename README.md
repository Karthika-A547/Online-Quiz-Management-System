OOP Concept

Classes represent entities like Student, Admin, Quiz.

Encapsulation secures data like passwords and scores.

Inheritance avoids duplication by using a common User class.

Polymorphism allows login to act differently for Admin and Student.

Abstraction hides the complex result calculation from the user.
